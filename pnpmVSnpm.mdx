# ⚡ Why is `pnpm` Faster than `npm`?

Both are package managers, but **pnpm wins in speed and efficiency** due to how it stores and links packages.

---

## 🧠 Key Differences

### 1. 📦 Shared Global Store with Hard Links

- `pnpm` **doesn’t duplicate packages** across projects.
- Uses a **global content-addressable store**.
- Projects receive **hard links** to the global packages.

> ✅ Less disk space  
> ✅ Faster install times

---

### 2. 🔒 Immutable Package Store

- Packages are **read-only** once installed.
- Guarantees safe, reliable caching.

---

### 3. 🧬 Strict Dependency Resolution

- Enforces that each package only accesses what it explicitly depends on.
- Helps avoid hidden bugs.

---

### 4. 🏎️ Faster Repeated Installs

- Cached packages make reinstalling almost instant.
- No need to re-download or re-copy files.
