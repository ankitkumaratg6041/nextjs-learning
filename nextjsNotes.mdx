# 🚀 What is Next.js?

**Next.js** is a **React framework** for building **fullstack web applications**.

While React alone can build apps, it's **not feasible for production-level apps** without adding multiple third-party tools.

## 🧠 React vs Next.js

### 🔹 React
- A **JavaScript library** focused only on the **UI (view layer)**.
- You need to decide and configure other parts of the app yourself (e.g. routing, SSR, bundling).
- Not opinionated — lots of freedom, but more setup.

### 🔹 Next.js
- A **framework built on top of React**.
- Provides **all essential production features out of the box**:
  - ✅ Routing
  - ✅ Optimized rendering
  - ✅ Data fetching
  - ✅ API routes (backend support)
  - ✅ Code splitting and bundling
  - ✅ Compilation
- Has **opinionated structure and conventions** that guide how apps should be built.

# 🎯 Why Learn Next.js?

Next.js **simplifies** building scalable and production-ready applications.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. 📁 File-Based Routing
- Traditional React needs libraries like `react-router-dom`.
- Next.js gives **routing out of the box** — just create files inside the `pages/` or `app/` directory.

### 2. 🧩 API Routes
- Create backend logic in the same project.
- Write serverless functions inside `app/api` or `pages/api`.

### 3. 🧠 Rendering Modes
- Supports **CSR** (Client Side Rendering) and **SSR** (Server Side Rendering).
- Helps with **SEO and performance**.

### 4. 🔄 Built-in Data Fetching
- Async/await friendly functions like `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, or new `fetch()` in App Router.

### 5. 🎨 Styling Support
- Supports CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, Sass, and more.
- Works well with design systems.

### 6. ⚙️ Optimizations
- Image optimization (`next/image`)
- Script loading (`next/script`)
- Smart bundling

### 7. 🛠 Dev & Prod Build System
- Built-in fast builds, live reloads, and optimized production output using **Webpack** or **Turbopack**.
