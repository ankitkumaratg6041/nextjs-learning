## 💧 What is Hydration in React?

Hydration is the process of taking **server-rendered HTML** and turning it into a **fully interactive React application** in the browser.

---

### 🔥 Why Hydration Exists

When using **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** or **React Server Components (RSC)**, React renders components as **static HTML** on the server and sends it to the browser.

But plain HTML:
- ✅ Loads fast
- ❌ Can’t handle interactivity (e.g., `onClick`, `useState`)

So React needs to “hydrate” this HTML to make it **interactive** on the client side.

---

### 🧠 What Happens During Hydration

1. The browser receives **pre-rendered HTML** from the server.
2. React JS bundle loads in the browser.
3. React **matches the HTML with the virtual DOM** structure.
4. It **attaches event listeners**, **activates hooks**, and **restores state**.

This process is called **hydration**.

### 📌 Example

#### `Counter.tsx` (Client Component)

```tsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Clicked {count} times</button>;
}

## What happens:
**On the server:**
HTML like ```html<button>Clicked 0 times</button>``` is sent to the browser.

**In the browser:**
React hydrates the button → attaches onClick, activates useState.

### 🧊 Dry HTML vs 💧 Hydrated React

| **State**             | **Description**                        | **Interactive?** | **React Active?** |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Before Hydration**   | Static HTML rendered on the server     | ❌ No             | ❌ No              |
| **After Hydration**    | Fully React-powered component          | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes             |

### 🧱 In Next.js App Router

- **Server Components**: Rendered on the server, **never hydrated** (no interactivity).
- **Client Components**: Rendered on the server as static HTML, then **hydrated in the browser**.

```tsx
// app/page.tsx (server component)
import Counter from './Counter'; // client component

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <Counter /> {/* Will be hydrated in browser */}
    </div>
  );
}

### ✅ Summary

| **Concept**   | **Meaning**                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hydration** | Making server-rendered HTML interactive with React            |
| **When**      | After React loads in the browser                              |
| **Why**       | To enable interactivity like state, events, etc.              |
| **Used In**   | Only for `'use client'` components (not server components)    |

> 💡 Without hydration, components are just plain HTML with no behavior.
